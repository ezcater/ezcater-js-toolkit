## [Unreleased]
### Breaking changes
- Drop support for `eslint-plugin-prettier`, which is no longer recommended by Prettier. This is a breaking change because if consumers have any code comments including `prettier/prettier` eslint will now fail. Consumers are now expected to run `prettier --check` in CI if they want to keep the code quality validation. It's recommended to use `prettier --write` in lint-staged if you want to auto-format code and or use VSCode Prettier extension.
- Change `eslint-plugin-import` to be a peer dependency rather than exposed a dependency of the config. This will require consumers to add `eslint-plugin-import` to their dev dependencies.
