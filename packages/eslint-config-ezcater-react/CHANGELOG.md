## [Unreleased]
- fix: allow eslint v8 as peer dependency

### Breaking changes
- Upgrade to `eslint-config-ezcater-base@5` which drops support for `eslint-plugin-prettier`. This is a breaking change because if consumers have any code comments including `prettier/prettier` eslint will now fail. Consumers are now expected to run `prettier --check` in CI if they wantÂ to keep the code quality validation. It's recommended to use `prettier --write` in lint-staged if you want to auto-format code and or use VSCode Prettier extension.
